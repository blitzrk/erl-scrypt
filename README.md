erl-scrypt 
==========

erl-scrypt is a simple wrapper around Colin Pervical's [scrypt key derivation function](http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html). 
# Building 

Currently, only a rebar build is supported

```
./rebar compile
```

To use as a dependency, add the following line to your `rebar.config`

```erlang
{deps, [{scrypt, "1.2.0", {git, "https://github.com/TanYewWei/erl-scrypt.git", {tag, "1.2.0"}}}]}
```

As a dependency on elixir projects, add the following tuple to the `deps:` keyword of your `mix.exs`

```elixir
{ :scrypt, github: "TanYewWei/erl-scrypt", tag: "1.2.0", compile: "rebar compile" }
```

# Dependencies

The following are required to build the scrypt utility:

* gcc
* make
* libssl-dev

Ubuntu and Debian users can install the dependencies via the command 

```
sudo apt-get install gcc make libssl-dev
```

# Usage

To test from the shell, run the `shell` script. This should give you an erlang prompt with the scrypt application already started.

```erlang
Pass = "some secure password!".
{ok, Hash} = scrypt:hash( Pass ).
true = scrypt:verify( Hash, Pass ).

{ok, Ciphertext} = scrypt:encrypt( "Hello!", "A Strong Password" ).
{ok, Plaintext} = scrypt:decrypt( Ciphertext, "A Strong Password" ).
Plaintext = <<"Hello!">>.

%% With options
Options = [{maxmem, 1024}, {maxmemfrac, 0.2}, {maxtime, 1.0}].

P0 = "another secure password!".
{ok, H0} = scrypt:hash( P0, Options ).
true = scrypt:verify( H0, P0, Options ).

{ok, C0} = scrypt:encrypt( "Hello Again!", "Another Strong Password", Options ).
{ok, T0} = scrypt:decrypt( C0, "Another Strong Password", Options ).
T0 = <<"Hello Again!">>.
```

Use in elixir is basically the same.

```elixir
pass = "some secured password!"
{ :ok, hash } = :scrypt.hash(pass)
true = :scrypt.verify(hash, pass)

{ :ok, ciphertext } = :scrypt.encrypt("hello!", "a strong password")
{ :ok, plaintext } = :scrypt.decrypt(ciphertext, "a strong password")
^plaintext = "hello!"

## with options
opts = [maxmem: 1024, maxmemfrac: 0.2, maxtime: 1.0]

pass = "another secure password"
{ :ok, hash } = :scrypt.hash(pass, opts)
```

Only 4 functions are exported:

```erlang
-spec hash(Pass::iolist(), Options::options()) -> {ok, Hash::binary()} | {error, Reason::term()}.
-spec verify(Hash::iolist(), Pass::iolist(), Options::options()) -> boolean().
-spec encrypt(Plaintext::iolist(), Pass::iolist(), Options::options()) -> {ok, Ciphertext::binary()} | {error, Reason::term()}.
-spec decrypt(Ciphertext::iolist(), Pass::iolist(), Options::options()) -> {ok, Plaintext::binary()} | {error, Reason::term()}.

-type options() :: [ option_tuple() ].
-type option_tuple() :: {maxmem, integer()} 
                      | {maxmemfrac, float()}
                      | {maxtime, integer()}.
```

The options include:

* `maxmem` - the maximum number of `bytes` of memory to be used in the operation. Any value less than 1 MB (1048576 bytes) will be treated as 1 MB. **Defaults to 1048576**
* `maxmemfrac` - the maximum memory to be used as fraction of total available resources. Any value equal to 0 or greater than 0.5 will result in 0.5 being used. **Defaults to 0.125**
* `maxtime` - the maximum time in `seconds` that the particular operation will take. **Defaults to 5**

# Resource Management

`erl-scrypt` makes no attempt to take care of the management of CPU and memory resources for the user.

To avoid starving out the rest of your server resources, I'd recommend to use some worker pool manager together with the `scrypt_worker` module. A good choice would be [`poolboy`](https://github.com/devinus/poolboy) or [`pooler`](https://github.com/seth/pooler).

When doing this, you should assume that as many scrypt processes as you allow workers would be running concurrently, and plan accordingly. For example, using the default `maxmemfrac` option of `0.125`, I would not allow more than 4 workers to be spawned per machine (to stay below 50% memory utilisation).

# Quirks

* decryption and encryption tend to not play nice with `maxtime` options set to below 4 seconds (and because I'm no crypto expert, I have no idea why). Using the default 5 seconds is recommended.
